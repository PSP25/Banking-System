Here’s a GitHub repository README.md file for your Banking System Console Application:

# Banking System Console Application

A feature-rich C++ console-based banking application to manage bank accounts, handle deposits and withdrawals, perform balance inquiries, and store account data persistently using file handling.

## Project Overview
This project is a simple banking system built using **C++** with an object-oriented approach. It demonstrates the core functionality of a banking system with file handling for persistent storage and showcases key concepts like OOP, data structures, exception handling, and operator overloading.

## Features
- **Account Creation**: Users can open new accounts by providing their first name, last name, and initial balance.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Users can check the balance of their accounts by entering the account number.
- **Deposit & Withdrawal**: Users can deposit or withdraw money from their accounts. Withdrawal is only allowed if there are sufficient funds.
- **Account Closure**: Users can close their accounts and remove all associated data.
- **Persistent Storage**: All account details are stored in a file and retrieved upon running the program.

## Tech Stack & Concepts Used
- **C++ Programming**: Core language for development.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes (`Account`, `Bank`), inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **File Handling**: Persistent data storage using file input/output (I/O) operations.
- **Exception Handling**: Managed errors like insufficient funds during withdrawals.
- **Data Structures**: Utilized `map` for efficient account storage and management.
- **Operator Overloading**: Simplified file I/O and display of account details.

## System Design
- **Classes**:
  - `Account`: Represents an individual bank account, storing details such as account number, name, and balance.
  - `Bank`: Manages all accounts and provides the main functionalities (open, close, deposit, withdraw, balance enquiry).
  
- **Persistent Data Management**: Account data is stored in a file (`Bank.data`) and is retrieved every time the application starts, ensuring that accounts are retained between sessions.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/banking-system.git
   cd banking-system

	2.	Compile the project using a C++ compiler:

g++ banking_system.cpp -o banking_system


	3.	Run the executable:

./banking_system


	4.	Follow the on-screen instructions to use the banking system.

Sample Commands

Here are some example commands that you can use once the system is running:

	•	Open a new account
	•	Check your account balance
	•	Deposit or withdraw money
	•	Close an account
	•	View all accounts

Future Enhancements

	•	Adding a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
	•	Replacing file handling with a database (e.g., MySQL) for larger-scale systems.
	•	Adding authentication features (e.g., passwords for accounts).
	•	Implementing loan management and interest calculation.

Code Snippet

Here’s a snippet showing how file I/O is handled for account persistence:

ofstream & operator<<(ofstream &ofs, Account &acc) {
    ofs << acc.accountNumber << endl;
    ofs << acc.firstName << endl;
    ofs << acc.lastName << endl;
    ofs << acc.balance << endl;
    return ofs;
}

ifstream & operator>>(ifstream &ifs, Account &acc) {
    ifs >> acc.accountNumber;
    ifs >> acc.firstName;
    ifs >> acc.lastName;
    ifs >> acc.balance;
    return ifs;
}
